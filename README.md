This repository contains the final code used to generate the simulations and figures for the purpose of submitting a Master's dissertation "Multilevel Radial Basis Function Approximation of PDEs" at the Univeristy of Oxford, Trinity 2024.

The standard multilevel implementations for 1-D and 2-D are included in ```rbf.py```.

The modified implementations (namely the efficient/timed implementations as used in Chapter 4 Section 1) are included in the ```rbf_apaptive.py```.

The figures themselves, organized by chapter, are included in the notebook ```dis_figures.ipynb```.
